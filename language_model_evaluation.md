# Language Model Evaluation Report

## Objective
The primary objective of this evaluation is to assess and compare the performance of four language models in answering a specific question about the "Pillars of the Unified Digital Platform Policy" implemented by the UAE Government.

## Methodology

### Models Evaluated
- GPT-3.5-Turbo
- GPT-4
- Llama-2-70b-chat
- Falcon-40b-instruct

### Metrics Used for Evaluation
1. Relevance: Measures how relevant the response is to the asked question.
2. Completeness: Assesses whether the response fully addresses the question.
3. Accuracy: Evaluates the correctness of the information provided.
4. Clarity: Rates how understandable the response is.
5. Response Time: Measures the time taken by each model to provide a response.

## Evaluation Procedure
A standardized query about the "Pillars of the Unified Digital Platform Policy" was posed to each model. Responses were collected and analyzed based on the defined metrics. Each model was scored from 1 to 5 for each metric, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest.
